  <h2>css</h2>
  <p>I’d like to introduce myself in this time of CSS3 excitement and changes here at CSS3.info. Some of you may already know me under the nom de plume of SuzyUK from the CSS Forum at WebmasterWorld. My ‘name ‘has always confused people as I registered on t’internet in the days ‘ASL’ pests and my previous nicknames never even gave away my gender.

To make it easy, my name is Claire ‘Suzy’ Campbell, Suzy really is my middle name. In my real life I answer to both Claire or Suzy, and on the Web I answer to both too though mostly it’s Suzy. To try and make it easy I’m also a recent twitter convert so I combined them both – you can find me on @ClaireSuzy . I’m Scottish, from the Doric Speaking region so sometimes native ‘wee’ words might crop up in my speech.
